# Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

This repository provides an implementation of the Random Forest Regressor algorithm for predicting sales. The Random Forest Regressor is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle complex data and provide accurate predictions. By following the steps outlined below, you can use this algorithm to predict sales for your business.

## Installation

To use this implementation, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, the following packages are required:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install these packages by running the following command:

```
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd sales-prediction
   ```

3. Prepare your data:

   - Ensure that your sales data is in a CSV format.
   - Make sure your data has relevant features such as date, product, price, and quantity sold.
   - Split your data into training and testing sets.


4. The predicted sales values will be displayed in the console and saved to a CSV file.
